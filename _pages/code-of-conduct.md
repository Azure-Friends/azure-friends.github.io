# Azure & Friends - Code of Conduct

Our community welcomes participants from around the world with different experiences, unique perspectives, and great ideas to share.
Organizers of this group are from various companies which emphasizes the community and sharing aspect.
Organizers are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, 
sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, 
personal appearance, race, religion, sexual identity and orientation, or other such characteristics.

## Our Standards

Diversity is one of our greatest strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. 
To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to. This code applies equally to all attendees, speakers, and organizers.

This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. 
Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities 
in which we participate.

### Encouraged

- Be kind and courteous. We treat our fellow community members with the empathy, respect, and dignity all humans deserve. 
Keep in mind that public communication is received by many people you don't know, so before sending a message, please ask yourself whether someone from a different context would misunderstand it.
- Respect differences of opinion and remember that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a single right answer; we will find the best solutions by engaging in constructive discussion, with everybody bringing their unique viewpoint and experience to the table.
- Remember that everyone was inexperienced at some point. We want to encourage newcomers to join our community irrespective of their background. Always assume good intentions and a willingness to learn, just as you are willing to evolve your own opinion as you gain new insights.
- We make it easy for beginners and experts alike to give Azure-related talks. We're completely independent, seeking to benefit everyone involved with Azure by creating opportunities for collaboration

### Discouraged

- Keep unstructured critique to a minimum. We encourage sharing ideas and perspectives, so please ensure that your feedback is constructive and relevant.
- Avoid aggressive and micro-aggressive behavior, such as unconstructive criticism, providing corrections that do not improve the conversation, repeatedly interrupting or talking over someone else, feigning surprise at someone's lack of knowledge or awareness about a topic, or subtle prejudice (for example, comments like "That's so easy my grandmother could do it.").
- We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean, or harass anyone. See examples of unacceptable behavior below. 
- In particular, we don't tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.
- Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member's behavior, please contact the meetup organizers immediately.
- Likewise, any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.
- Claiming that you are exercising your free speech right while not following our Code of Conduct; we have chosen to create this meetup group for technical expression and not as a platform for you to exercise what you feel counts as free speech. If you need a platform for free speech, please find a more suitable arrangement.

#### Examples of unacceptable behavior

- Violence, threats of violence, or violent language directed against another person.
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
- Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
- Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”).
- Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
- Inappropriate photography or recording.
- Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before touching them.
- Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following (online or in person).
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
- Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.

## Moderation

These are the policies for upholding our community's standards of conduct. If you feel that an event or interaction needs moderation, 
please contact the meetup organizers.

- Remarks that violate the above code of conduct, including hateful, hurtful, oppressive, 
or exclusionary remarks, are not allowed. (Cursing is allowed, but never targeting another user, and never in a hateful or aggressive manner.)
- Organizers will warn attendees who make remarks inconsistent with the above code of conduct.
- If the warning is unheeded, the attendee will be asked to leave the event to cool off.
- If the attendee comes back and continues to make trouble, they may be banned from future events.
- Organizers may choose at their discretion to lift the ban if it was a first offense and if the attendee makes suitable amends with the offended party.
- If you think an organizer's action is unjustified, please take it up with that organizer, or with a different organizer, in private. Complaints about moderation during the event are not allowed.
- Organizers are held to a higher standard than other community members. If an organizer acts inappropriately, they should expect less leeway than others.
