## What is Azure and Friends?

Azure and Friends is for making Azure friends. :heart_eyes:

We arrange events, share knowledge across companies and learn through open discussion. As an open community, we make it easy for beginners and experts alike to give Azure-related talks. We are completely independent, seeking to benefit everyone involved with Azure by creating opportunities for collaboration. Let’s come together and get inspired!

## About Azure and Friends events

Azure and Friends events offer a fresh twist on a familiar topic: We offer a safe environment to give and attend all kinds of talks, take part in interactive group activities and get new ideas from interesting people. 

There is no typical Azure and Friends speaker; our speakers come from all backgrounds and levels of experience. We foster diversity and enable newcomers to get going with Azure. As a community, we constantly evaluate and evolve our events and approach to keep things fresh.

We'll be posting our content on social media, such as Twitter and LinkedIn. If you'd like to be notified of any future events, please subscribe to our [Mailing List](http://eepurl.com/hMQdOT). We promise we won't spam you.
