## What is Azure and Friends?

Azure and Friends is for making Azure friends. <3

We arrange events, share knowledge across companies and learn through open discussion. As an open community, we make it easy for beginners and experts alike to give Azure-related talks. We are independent, seeking to benefit everyone involved with Azure by creating opportunities for collaboration. Let's come together and get inspired!

## About Azure and Friends events

Azure and Friends events offer a fresh twist on a familiar topic: We facilitate a safe environment to give and attend all kinds of talks, engage in interactive group activities, and get new ideas from fellow peers.

There is no typical Azure and Friends speaker; our speakers come from all backgrounds and levels of experience. We foster diversity and enable newcomers to get going with Azure. As a community, we constantly evaluate and evolve our events and approach to keep things fresh.
